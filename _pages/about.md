About me
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Prof. Ali R. Butt](https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/) in the [Distributed Systems & Storage Laboratory](https://dssl.cs.vt.edu/) at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am a recipient of Kuwait University scholarship to pursue both my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. My research interests include Distributed Systems, High Performance Computing, Systems for ML, and ML for Systems. I am currently interested in optimizing the performance of systems for ML.

You can find my CV [here](https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~hadeel89/hadeelcv.pdf).

Research
======

I have been performing research on containers, container management systems (e.g., Kubernetes), and system schedulers for ML jobs on heterogeneous resources. Recently, I analyzed the performance of ML jobs on heterogeneous single-GPUs and proposed a heterogeneity-aware GPU scheduler that utilizes ML-based resource and runtime predictions as well as GPU sharing (i.e., GPU collocation) to improve GPU allocation and utilization and ensure the successful completion of ML jobs in heterogeneous GPU clusters.
