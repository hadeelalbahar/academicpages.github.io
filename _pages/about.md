About me
======

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at Kuwait University, Sabah Al-Salem University City, Kuwait. My research interests include High Performance Computing, Systems for ML, and ML for Systems. I am currently interested in optimizing the performance of systems for ML.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech advised by Dr. Ali R. Butt in the Distributed Systems & Storage Laboratory. 

You can find my CV [here](https://hadeelalbahar.github.io/files/hadeelcv.pdf).

Research
======

I have conducted research on containers, container management systems such as Kubernetes, and system schedulers for Machine Learning (ML) jobs on various resources. Recently, I analyzed the performance of ML jobs on heterogeneous single-GPUs and developed a heterogeneity-aware GPU scheduler. This scheduler utilizes ML-based predictions of resources and runtime, as well as GPU sharing (GPU collocation), to enhance GPU allocation and utilization. The proposed scheduler ensures the successful completion of ML jobs in heterogeneous GPU clusters.
