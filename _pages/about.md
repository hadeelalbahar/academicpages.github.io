About me
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate working with [Prof. Ali R. Butt](https://people.cs.vt.edu/butta/) in the [Distributed Systems & Storage Laboratory](https://dssl.cs.vt.edu/) at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am a recipient of Kuwait University scholarship to pursue both my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. My research interests include Distributed Systems, High Performance Computing, Systems for ML, and ML for Systems. I am currently interested in optimizing the performance of systems for ML.

You can find my CV [here](https://hadeelalbahar.github.io/files/hadeelcv.pdf).

Research
======

I have conducted research on containers, container management systems such as Kubernetes, and system schedulers for Machine Learning (ML) jobs on various resources. Recently, I analyzed the performance of ML jobs on heterogeneous single-GPUs and developed a heterogeneity-aware GPU scheduler. This scheduler utilizes ML-based predictions of resources and runtime, as well as GPU sharing (GPU collocation), to enhance GPU allocation and utilization. The proposed scheduler ensures the successful completion of ML jobs in heterogeneous GPU clusters.
